# Symphony Machine Translation

## TODOs

- The `translators.actors` package is temporary and may change / be removed in the future.
- Use monolingual data to pre-train (or even mix with normal training) the interlingua translators (i.e., enforce
  consistency between the human-to-interlingua and the interlingua-to-human translators).
