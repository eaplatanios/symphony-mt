# Symphony Machine Translation

We plan to soon publish a documentation website with 
information on how to use this software package. For now, 
we provide some instructions on how to reproduce the 
experiments presented in our paper, soon to be presented 
at EMNLP 2018, *Contextual Parameter Generation for 
Universal Neural Machine Translation*, Emmanouil A. 
Platanios, Mrinmaya Sachan, Graham Neubig, and Tom M. 
Mitchell.

## Running Experiments

Example experiment scripts are located in the `scripts` 
directory. We will soon update this with the specific 
scripts used to reproduce the experiments presented in 
our paper.
